This is my sandwhich recipe 
toast two pices of bread with butter or ghee evenely on a pan 
While the bread is toasting place a slice of cheese on top of the bread 
When the bread and cheese is getting toasted slice some onions , tomatos , cucumebers and more veggies as you want 
After the bread becomes light brown take it out of the pan
Fill your veggies in and for taste add some seasonings and chille flakes and your shadwhich is reday to eat .
